The Odin Project
First attempt at coding a website
This was done over a numer of weeks due to work/holiday commitments.
Challenges:
-aligning items on a page
-did not use enough divs/classes making editing of specific content difficult
-did not use flex: property properly resulting in some distortion
-not properly understanding flexbox. Though my understanding signifcantly improved at the end in terms of comprehension.

Addressing challenges:
-I will review the flexbox content on the Odin project/Kevin Powell
-I will attempt a redesign of this project at a later date after working on others

Overall not perfect and much work could be done to improve. I look forward to learning more about css/flexbox and reviewing this project to improve it.
